What this track rewards
The best end-to-end project or novel use-case. This is the hero prize and the clearest signal of what the hackathon is about: agents that can reliably complete real workflows with payments/settlement.

Minimum bar (must-have)
Demonstrates a real-world workflow: discover → decide → pay/settle → outcome
Uses agents/protocols in a meaningful way
What judges look for (how to win)
Real utility: solves a real commerce task with a clear user value proposition
Reliability: deterministic flow, good error handling, and sensible defaults
Trust + safety: guardrails (spend caps, allowlists, confirmation steps, policy limits)
Receipts/logs: clear evidence of what the agent did and why (audit trail)
Strong example themes
Pay-per-API workflows (data procurement → decision → execution)
“Agent buys tools to complete a task” (tool discovery + paid calls)
Merchant automation (inventory/order/customer service)
Subscriptions and renewals (agent manages plan, billing, changes)
Travel booking with a payment + receipt trail
Submission requirements
Repo + README, quickstart instructions
2–3 minute demo video with video posted on twitter
Evidence: screenshots/logs of x402/AP2 flows + final outcome
Agentic Tool Usage on x402
Judge: Kevin Leffew, GTM Lead, CDP
Rewards
1st Place: $2,000 USDC + $5,000 Google Credits
2nd Place: $1,000 USDC
Track Brief
Build demand-side agents that autonomously discover, reason over, and pay for chained tool calls in order to accomplish an end-to-end task. The emphasis is on CDP Wallets + x402 payments woven into multi-step tool chaining.

Required components (must-have)
Uses CDP Wallets (embedded or server-hosted) to custody funds and sign payment payloads
Uses x402 in a real flow: HTTP 402 → pay → retry
Demonstrates tool chaining: at least two paid steps or two paid tool calls in one workflow
Shows cost reasoning (budget awareness, tradeoffs, or pruning behavior)
What “excellent” looks like (win conditions)
Uses the x402 flow correctly and repeatedly (not a one-off payment)
Clear economic logic: agent chooses tools based on price/value
Well-instrumented: receipts/logs, spend tracking, step-by-step trace
Good UX even for an agent: pricing surfaced, confirmations optional, sane defaults
Example project ideas
Agent assembles a report by paying for data sources (multiple paid calls)
Agent runs a paid image generation → paid post scheduling → paid analytics loop
Agent chains: fetch leads → enrich → write outreach → send campaign, paying per step
Submission requirements
Demo video showing 402 challenge + payment + retry
CDP wallet integration proof (config / flow)
Logged spend summary (per tool call)
Best Integration of AP2
Judge: Nalin Mittal, Product Manager Web3, Google Cloud
Rewards
1st Place: $2,000 USDC + $5,000 Google Cloud Credits
2nd Place: $1,000 USDC + $5,000 Google Cloud Credits
Track Brief
Best use of AP2 for authorization + settlement inside an agent workflow. This track is about proving clean and reusable patterns: intent → authorization → settlement → receipt.

Required components (must-have)
Implements a clean intent → authorization → settlement flow
Produces a receipt/record that’s auditable (for humans and/or systems)
What “excellent” looks like (win conditions)
“Feels like a reusable pattern” other teams can copy
Crisp separation of: intent creation, user approval (if human-present), settlement execution
Clear accountability: who authorized what, what got executed, what was delivered
Example project ideas
Shopping Agent — Main orchestrator; handles user requests
Merchant Agent — Handles product queries; creates signed CartMandates
Credentials Provider Agent — Holds user's payment credentials (wallets); facilitates payment
Merchant Payment Processor Agent — Settles payment on-chain via x402
Submission requirements
Demo video showing full AP2 flow and a failure mode
Receipt output (UI or structured JSON) demonstrating audit trail
Clear write-up of where authorization happens and how it’s enforced

Best Trading / DeFi Agent / AI Agent
Judge: Celeste Ang, Developer Relations Lead, Virtuals Protocol
Rewards:
1st Place: $2,000 USDC
2nd Place: $1,000 USDC
Track Brief
Best agent that trades, routes, hedges, farms, or manages positions with explicit safeguards.

Required components (must-have)
Executes at least one off-chain trade or onchain DeFi action (swap, LP, deposit/withdraw, borrow/repay, route)
Must include risk controls, such as:
spend cap, slippage bounds, allowlist/denylist, position sizing, timeouts, or human approval
Must explain why it acted
What “excellent” looks like (win conditions)
Auditable trail (e.g. tx hashes + reason codes)
Performance logic: what objective function it’s optimizing and why
An agent which researches and collects multiple data sources, combined with its own reasoning, to inform its trading or DeFi actions (i.e. not just trade execution)
An agent which provides autonomous and customized services for users (e.g. dependent on user risk appetite)
Example project ideas
Intent-based trading agent with guardrails and receipts
Rebalancing bot with spend caps + position limits
Agent that shops best liquidity route and executes under constraints
Submission requirements
Demo video
Deck or documentation with technical explanation behind agent capabilities
Bonus bounties

2nd Place: $1,000 USDC + $2,500 SKALE Credits
Track Brief
Build the best application that uses BITE v2 (Blockchain Integrated Threshold Encryption) to enable conditional transactions — where sensitive transaction details remain encrypted and are only revealed/executed when a condition is satisfied. The emphasis is on proving a real “why private + conditional” workflow that cannot be done well with standard public execution.

Required components (must-have)
Uses BITE v2 in a way that materially changes the workflow (not just “privacy as a tagline”)
Demonstrates a conditional trigger (e.g., decrypt/execute only when condition(s) are met)
Shows encrypted → condition check → decrypt/execute → receipt (or equivalent trace)
What “excellent” looks like (win conditions)
Clear why the condition and encryption matter (prevents leakage, front-running, or premature disclosure)
A clean, auditable lifecycle:
policy/condition definition → encrypted intent → execution → receipt/logs
Strong UX and trust model:
“What is private?” “When does it unlock?” “Who can trigger?” “What happens if it fails?”
Demonstrates a realistic commerce-grade use case with guardrails (limits, allowlists, human approval if needed)
Example project ideas
Conditional payment: escrow-like payment released only when delivery proof/attestation is present
Private quote / private bidding: hidden amount/terms until the counterparty accepts
Policy-based execution: agent can transact only within encrypted constraints (spend caps, allowlists)
Private procurement: agent buys data/services without broadcasting strategy/inputs until finality
Conditional subscription renewal: renew only if SLA metrics are met (otherwise auto-cancel)
Submission requirements
Demo video showing the conditional flow end-to-end (encrypted → trigger → execution)
Evidence of BITE v2 usage (logs/trace/screenshots and a short explanation)
Clear description of:
what stays encrypted
what condition unlocks execution
how failure is handled
Receipt output (UI or structured log) showing what executed and why
